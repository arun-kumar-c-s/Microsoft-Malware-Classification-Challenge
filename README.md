# Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (BIG 2015)
####	Objective 
To classify given the given disassembly and bytecode of malware files into their respective 10 categories.
####	Dataset
200 GB of train data provided on Kaggle was used for training, validation and testing.
####	Performance Metric
- Primary metric - Multi Class Log Loss (MCLL). 
- Secondary Metric â€“ Confusion Matrix.
####	Featurization
- Image pixels of files in binary
- Unigram and Bigram features
- file size
- disassembly code-based features 
- NOTE: These features were extracted using multiprocessing on 8 core CPU with 64 GB ram N2D instance on Google Compute Platform (GCP).
####	Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis was done using matplotlib and seaborn.
####	Training
Hyperopt with TPE was used for hyperparameter tuning. Different models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBClassifier were tested but XGBClassifier gave the best result.
####	Evaluation
The dummy model gave a Multi Class Log Loss of 2.20. XGBoost classifier outperformed every model with a MCLL of 0.02.
