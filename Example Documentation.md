-   Training set: 60%
-   Validation set: 20%
-   Test set: 20%

## Model

The classification model used in this project is a **[insert model name]**. The model has the following key hyperparameters:

-   **Hyperparameter 1**: [insert description]
-   **Hyperparameter 2**: [insert description]

# Example of Plant Dataset
Here's an example of a data science project portfolio for a classification problem:

1.  Title: Plant Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
    
2.  Introduction: In this project, we aim to classify different types of plants based on their characteristics, using a convolutional neural network (CNN). We have collected a dataset of plant images, which we have preprocessed and used to train a classifier.
    
3.  Data: The dataset consists of 10,000 images of plants, which have been collected from various sources. The images have been resized to 256x256 pixels and normalized to have zero mean and unit variance. We have also extracted features such as color and shape, which have been used as input to the CNN.
    
4.  Methods: We have implemented a CNN using the PyTorch library, with three convolutional layers and two fully-connected layers. The CNN has been trained using stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 128. We have also used data augmentation techniques such as random cropping and horizontal flipping to improve the generalization of the model.
    
5.  Results: The trained classifier has achieved an accuracy of 95% on the validation set, with a precision of 0.96, a recall of 0.95, and an F1 score of 0.95 for each plant class. We have also visualized the confusion matrix to show the performance of the classifier on the different plant classes.
    
6.  Conclusion: The results show that our CNN-based classifier is able to accurately classify different types of plants based on their characteristics. In future work, we plan to incorporate additional data and explore different hyperparameter settings to further improve the performance of the model.
